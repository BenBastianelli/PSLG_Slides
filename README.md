<h1 align="center"><strong>📒 PSLG_Slides 📒</strong></h1>

### So if you're reading this, I guess this idea of mine survived at least longer than 1 year — which is pretty cool!

This, as the name infers, is a GitHub repository with the goal of preserving previous years' PSLG slides  
as an attempt to aid newer PSLG Leaders in creating interesting challenges and teaching topics  
in the most starved-college-student-digestible way possible.

<h2 align="center"><strong>🛠️ Set-Up Instructions 🛠️ </strong></h2>

Now, seeing as though you are a PSLG leader, I could work under the pretense that you know how to use GitHub.  
But I feel like that would be unfair if you're a rare edge case — a student who is a strong programmer  
but has never heard of this beautiful staple of a VCS.

There are a few prerequisites to getting these files off of our repository and neatly onto your local machine:  
The first of which is to install and set up **Git**.

If for some reason you're scared and don't trust me feel free to download git through your own channels but heres the link to the official git installer.

Link : [Git installer](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Once this is set-up you can open the terminal on your local device and create a new folder / directory where you want to keep all of these fun new files! (That doesn't sound ominous at all!!)<br>
with the directory created you can now navigate to it on the terminal and enter the following commands:
```
# To Create a local git repository
git init

# Check if it was initiialised correctly, you should see anything but an error pop up
git status

# Creates a connection between your local repository and this remote repository.
git add remote origin <INSERT LINK IN NEXT COMMIT BECAUSE I'M LAZY>

# To copy all the files into you're local repository
git clone origin 
```

**andddddddddddddddddd youre done!** Give yourself a pat on the back, now what I'm hoping will happen in the future is someone will be entrusted at the end of your term to collect as many of your years students slides as humanly possible (hopefully someone with git knowledge) and they will then push all these slides into new directories and sub-directories partitioned in the same fashion I have mine.

So thats it from me, to you budding future PSLG members I wish you luck and the very best in this semester of directing learning and always try to remember its just as much about fun and keeping the students engaged and interacting as it is teaching them!
